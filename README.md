# Floodmate
This is an idea for the Microsoft Codefundo++ event.

*Until now, people affected by floods are: 
  1. Not given any warning or indication that a flood might be imminent.
  2. Left helpless and resourceless when disaster strikes.
  3. Left waiting for a considerable period of time for relief material to arrive to them.*
 
This is where our app comes in.

# What we are planning to do:
 
 Floodmate is an app designed to:
 1. Predict the possibility of a place getting flooded, via rainfall statistics and other information.
 2. Alert the users about an imminent flood in their area. 
 3. Provide a one-click SOS system to ask for relief material, and alert the authorities at the same time.
 4. Specify methods of payment in case someone wants to donate money, and list down addresses for donation of relief material (clothes,       food, etc. )
 5. Manage an inventory of relief material and donations in the backend.
 
 # How we will work this idea: 
 
  1. *Prediction:* We will tie-up with local meteorological offices of all major towns and cities to get rainfall information and river                      levels, so that we get an indication of the places susceptible to floods. 
  2. *Alert:*      Each user who registers on the app will receive a notification in case their location (entered manually or via GPS)                        happens to be around any prospective/affected area.
  3. *SOS:* The app will have an SOS button to ask for help, which will be available as per the location of the user, to prevent any         misuse.
  4. *Donations:* The app will have a section for accepting donations, powered by secure payment methods and due acknowledgment after payment. If any user wishes to donate their own material, they may drop it at some designated collection centres listed in-app.
  5. *Inventory:* This is conducted entirely in the backend. The donations we receive will be kept accounted for, and this information shall not be available to users.

# How users can get started

The app will be based on a signup/login platform. New users signup by entering in their locations and contact details. Existing users can login through an OTP feature linked to their contact numbers.

# What technologies we might use

As of now, we're planning to build the app using C# and Python. We're intending it to work on the Windows platform, and may expand to other platforms given time.
